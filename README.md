To play this game, first clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/fonsecapeter/ruby_chess`, then run the game `ruby ruby_chess/game.rb`.

Ruby chess was written in ruby, implementing the cursorable module from rglassett's [ruby-cursor-game](https://github.com/rglassett/ruby-cursor-game). We followed the best practices of OOP to keep the code DRY and robust, complete with unit tests.
