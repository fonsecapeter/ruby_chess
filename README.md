Ruby chess is a 2-player terminal game. It was written under the best practices of OOP to keep the code DRY and robust, complete with unit and integration tests. It also implements the cursorable module from rglassett's [ruby-cursor-game](https://github.com/rglassett/ruby-cursor-game).

To play this game, first clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/fonsecapeter/ruby_chess`, then run `ruby ruby_chess/game.rb`.
