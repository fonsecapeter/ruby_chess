Ruby Chess is a ruby implementation of a command-line chess game. It was written under the best practices of OOP to keep the code DRY and robust, complete with unit and integration tests. It also implements the cursorable module from rglassett's [ruby-cursor-game](https://github.com/rglassett/ruby-cursor-game).

To play this game, first clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/fonsecapeter/ruby_chess`, then run `ruby ruby_chess/game.rb`. This will default to playing against the computer. If you would like to play with a friend, just run 'ruby ruby_chess/game.rb 2'. You can specify 0-2 players in this way (0 being a match between two computer players).
